//Using for loops, write a Javascript program to output the following
pattern -
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10      

Ans :

var num = 1;
var rows = 4;

for (var i = 1; i <= rows; i++)
 {
  var pattern = "";
  
  for (var j = 1; j <= i; j++) 
{
    pattern += num + " ";
    num++;
  }
  
  console.log(pattern);
}





note:In the outer loop (i), we iterate from 1 to the number of rows, which is 4 in this case.
 In the inner loop (j), we iterate from 1 to the current row number (i), adding the current value of num to the pattern string and incrementing num by 1 each time.
